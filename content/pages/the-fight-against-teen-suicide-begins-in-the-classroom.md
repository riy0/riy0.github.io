### 10代の自殺との戦いは教室で始まる | Brittni Darras

We've heard it in the news  – the U.S. is gripped by an epidemic of teen suicide. Following the suicide of one student and the attempted suicide of another, high school teacher Brittni Darras realized that just watching for the signs isn’t enough. But how do we begin to tackle such a complicated and insurmountable problem? The answer is surprisingly simple.

Brittni Darras is an English teacher at Rampart High School in Colorado Springs. Following the attempted suicide of one of Rampart’s students, Brittni wrote each of her 130 students personalized cards, earning her worldwide attention, the AspenPointe Hero of Mental Health Award, and the Mayor’s Young Leader Award in the category of Innovation in Education.  Brittni continues to advocate for suicide prevention and mental health awareness.
