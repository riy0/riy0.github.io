### 愛を教えることを始めましょう |  Volkan Tasdan

Volkan Tasdan is a teacher who sees a problem within the current teaching methods... Too much focus on behaving properly and not enough openess for the students' likes and dislikes. Putting yourself in their shoes and humorously engaging with 'wrong'  behavior, is what he means with a loving approach to teaching.  
His unorthodox ways of dealing with social interaction in the classroom make him one of the most popular teachers in Holland and in this lively talk you'll see that his enthusiasm is contagious.

聞きやすいトークだと思いますので是非。
